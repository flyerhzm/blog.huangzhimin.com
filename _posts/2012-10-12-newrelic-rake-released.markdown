4 months ago, I released [newrelic-workling][0] gem, which helps us
montior the performance of background jobs. We used it to find out a
GC performance issue. But we still have some cron jobs, who call rake
tasks, running in the black box.

So I created a new project [newrelic-rake][1] that adds newrelic
instrument for rake tasks. Now when I go to the newrelic, I can see the
rake tasks listed in Background tasks section, it shows me the average
execution time and call count for all rake tasks.

I can also see the performance breakdown for each rake task.

This rake task probably needs to use persistence net http or some c
extension http client, and reduce the GC calls.

**It's really important to do monitor first, then do optimize.**
