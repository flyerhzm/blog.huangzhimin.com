I just released [jruby-memcached 0.3.0][0], it runs about 10%-20%
faster than 0.2.0, I removed ruby code and totally wrote it by java
code, check out the [file changes][1].

2 weeks ago, I released jruby-memcached 0.1.0, in [that post][2] I
mentioned jruby-memcached response time in a request is 40+ms while
memcached.gem response time is 30+ms, it looked fine, but I was
still investigating the way to improve jruby-memcached performance.

After reading [jruby-spymemcached][3] gem and jruby source code, I
rewrote jruby-memcached by pure java code instead of ruby code,
because calling java from java is much faster than from ruby.

I did the performance compare with new jruby-memcached, the result is
as follows:

As you can see, jruby-memcached runs as fast as jruby-spymemcached, and
it provides memcached.gem compatible apis and hashing algorithm.
jruby-memcached is still slower than memcached.gem, and on production,
the response time for memcached has reduced to 40-ms, which is very
close to the memcached.gem performance.
